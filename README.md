# ardSeq
Simple breadboard sequencers for arduino

A collection of sketches practicing how to write a responsive user interface for sequencing with arduinos.
The end goal is to develop the tools to piece together the type of sequencer I would like to use for modular syntheizer,
and share the findings along the way.
